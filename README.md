## ‚ö†Ô∏è SECURITY WARNING

**IMPORTANT: This application MUST be protected with Cloudflare Zero Trust before deployment.** 

This tool has access to your CIPP API and can generate GDAP invitations. **Never expose this application directly to the internet without proper authentication controls.** Always set up Cloudflare Zero Trust protection as the first step before deploying.


## üìã Prerequisites

- Cloudflare account with Workers access and Zero Trust enabled
- CIPP instance with API access
- GitHub account

## üîê CIPP API Setup

To use this application, you need to configure API access in your CIPP instance:

1. **Create CIPP Role with Required Permissions**:
   - Create a new CIPP role with only these permissions:
     - `CIPP.Core.Read`
     - `Tenant.Relationship.ReadWrite`

2. **Generate API Key Credentials in CIPP**:
   - Log into your CIPP instance
   - Generate an API key credential and assign the newly created role to your API key
   - Store the credentials in a safe place (you'll need them for configuration)

3. **Configure Credentials**:
   - Input the API credentials into your `wrangler.toml` file
   - Add the API secret to Cloudflare secrets (as shown in deployment steps below)
